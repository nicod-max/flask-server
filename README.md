## Overview

This project is a demonstration of integrating **GitHub** with **Azure DevOps**. The goal is to track commits that reference specific work items on the Azure DevOps Board.

Using references like `AB#<WorkItemID>` in commit messages and pull requests, we can link commits to specific work items.
